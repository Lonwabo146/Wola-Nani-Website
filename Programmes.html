 <h2>Orphans and other vulnerable children's project (OVC) </h2>
   Wola Nani has embarked on an active programme supporting children with the goal of moving them from "vulnerability to resilience".
   Wola Nani has always recognized that children are the most vulnerable in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
   They are either infected or affected, through being orphaned by AIDS and driven into further vulnerability by poverty and lack of food and shelter.
   The program focuses on children aged from 7 to 18 years. Recruitment and selection is based on the following additional factors:<br/>- Orphaned children with the greatest social and financial need.<br/>
   - Children not linked with the Social Services Grant system. <br/>
   - Children with a traceable physical address.<br/>
   The geographic areas of focus are currently Mfuleni, Khayelitsha and Phillipi. <br /><br />
<h2> Lay Counselling Service in Public Health Facilities (FBC) </h2>
       For over seven years Wola Nani has partnered the Medical team at the Infectious Diseases Unit (IDC) at Red Cross Memorial Childrenâ€™s Hospital. In this regard we have been the trail blazer with regard to the counselling and support of caregivers and children infected with HIV. We currently have 5 lay counsellors based at the IDC unit of Red Cross.
Wola Nani also has a long-standing partnership with the Provincial Department of Health which places our counsellors at clinics in the Cape Town Metro Region. Our counsellors form an integral part of the team focusing on managed care through pre and post test HIV counseling, ARV treatment, literacy and Adherence support. 
        

      <h2>Craft project </h2>
	  Over 40 crafters who make a consistent weekly income work for the craft project, which has been running for more than 15 years and has a turnover of more than R1,000,000.00. 
  Our artisans' income enables them to give their children access to housing, food, clothing, and education. 
  The artisans of Wola Nani create recycled papier mache bowls, recycled paper jewelry, recycled magazine mirrors, designer light bulbs, beading, paper lampshades, and holders for tealight candles
